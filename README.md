# Database_Project_MYSQL
Database Management System in MYSQL 

This project simulates a relational database for a fictional company using MySQL. 
It defines and populates multiple tables (employee, branch, client, works_with, branch_supplier) to model business operations such as employee management, 
branch structure, client relations, and sales tracking. The project includes foreign key constraints, views, triggers, indexes, 
and stored procedures to demonstrate advanced database functionality, integrity enforcement, and analytical capabilities.

Key features of the project:

  Creation of normalized tables with proper relationships via foreign keys.

  Data manipulation using INSERT, UPDATE, and constraints like ON DELETE.

  Use of JOINs, GROUP BY, RANK(), SUBQUERIES, and WINDOW FUNCTIONS for insights.

  Creation of a stored procedure to fetch employee sales data based on conditions.

  A trigger to log insertions into a custom logging table.

  A view to show employee-manager-branch hierarchy.

  Indexes added for query performance optimization.

  Analysis queries to identify top-performing employees, salary comparisons, missing values, and data inconsistencies.
